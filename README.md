# Webset-Chrome-Extension

A Chrome Extension Fully Developed and Coded By Me.

The main purpose of this extension is to store a set of pages, a session or as I like to 
call it, a "WebSet". 
The WebSet consists of set of pages that can be stored as a list with a name. The pages
can be anything like a set of social networking sites or a set of Competitive Coding
platforms. The WebSet then provides option to load those set of webpages at your convinence
at any time you need and you will be able to load them at ease.
